# PyCurrencyConverter
By using this projects, we can convert two currencies to each other with a given amount.

## requirements
First you need to install requests module by using the command:

Then you should [sign up for free](https://apilayer.com/signup) for an api key in [APILAYER](https://apilayer.com).

Once you got the api key, you should set it as an environment variable using this in bash commandline:
`export APILAYER_KEY="YOUR API KEY"`
